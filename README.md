# STL
This repository contains exercises I completed for Ecole42, focusing on the usage of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) with containers, iterators, and algorithms. I utilized containers such as 'vector,' 'list,' 'multiset,' 'stack,' and 'map,' along with several algorithm functions. Additionally, this project includes implementations of Merge-Insertion Sort and Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) reimplementation.
